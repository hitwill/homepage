## Welcome

We invite you to join our team! Everyone is welcome to contribute code
via pull requests, to file issues on GitHub, to add to our
documentation, or to help out in any other way.

#### Code contributions to existing code

We encourage contributions to code referenced in this guide. Create a pull request from the code's repo, and we will integrate it or respond back if there is an issue.

#### Code contributions to new code

Simply link it in your starter kit or tutorial (see below) and we will update the link accordingly, when merging your pull request.
