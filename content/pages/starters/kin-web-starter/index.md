Few development platforms are as versatile as the web. While we try to support as many targets as possible, it's currently hard to support *everything*.

In order to get started with the Kin Web SDK, we suggest trying one of the starter kits.

There are currently starters for the following frameworks:

- [Angular](https://github.com/kin-sdk/kin-sdk-demo-angular) 
- [React](https://github.com/kin-sdk/kin-sdk-demo-react) 
- [Vue](https://github.com/kin-sdk/kin-sdk-demo-vue)
